Semantic Audience Matching API: Finding the Best Fit
================================================

# Studies: About API

# What is an API?
-API stands for Application Programming Interface.
-It acts as a bridge between different software applications, allowing them to communicate and exchange data.
-Think of it as a set of rules or protocols that define how applications can interact with each other.
-APIs enable developers to integrate data, services, and functionality from other applications without building everything from scratch.

# How Do APIs Work?
-Computers follow communication protocols to interact with each other. These protocols define the rules for communication.
-For web-based APIs, the HTTP protocol (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) is commonly used.
-The request-response cycle characterizes how APIs work:
-A client (e.g., your mobile phone or browser) sends a request to a server (a bigger computer).
-The server processes the request and sends back a response.
-The client receives the response and acts accordingly.
-The client provides information in the request, such as:
-URL: The web address where the request is made.
-Method: Whether data is requested (GET) or sent (POST).

# Plumber API in R
-Plumber is an R package that allows you to create web APIs by annotating your existing R functions.

# Hosting Plumber APIs
-DigitalOcean: Use the DigitalOcean integration included in Plumber for cloud hosting.
-RStudio Connect: A commercial platform for publishing R content, including Plumber APIs.
-Other approaches include PM2, Docker, and OpenCPU.
